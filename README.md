# Clustering and Classification Repository by Abhishek Das

## Principal Notebooks

1. The *BCGDV Clustering* notebook contains my solution for the unsupervised learning problem

2. The *BCGDV Classifier* notebook contains my attempt at the binary prediction model

3. The **BCGDV Clustering Updated** notebook is my second attempt at the clustering problem where I standardize the features. While this is good practice, given the scale of features was initially quite similar the results are not different from (1)
4. The **BCGDV Classification Updated** notebook is my second attempt at the binary problem where I control for noisy features and create a separate holdout set which I test my model on, instead of cross-validating on the entire dataset.

## Presentation

## Miscellaneous
Notebooks 3 and 4 are in response to the BCGDV data scientist who commented on my work in notebooks (1) and (2).
